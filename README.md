# Abalone-Machine-Learning-Project
The goal of this project is to use supervised machine learning to determine which machine learning model is best at accurately determining the age of abalone based on it's size. Scientists manually determine the age of abalone by cutting a cross section and counting their rings (similar to tree ring aging). A machine learning model that is trained to accurately determine abalone age could streamline this process for scientists.

### Models tested
Listed below are the models tested in this project along with their Validation RMSE values. Model accuracy is determined by their Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) values. The most accurate model that fits the data has an RMSE value closest to 0.

Multiple Linear regression- 1.5662\
Ridge Regression- 1.5641\
Lasso Regression- 1.5563\
Random Forest- 2.3366\
LightGBM- 1.5097

The most accurate model was LightGBM and the least accurate was Random Forest.

### Lessons Learned
This project was a fun exercise for me to practice machine learning through a hands on project. This project made me realize how much there is to learn in terms of machine learning. I would like to continue to learn more so that I can put it into practice and possibly create climate change or ocean acidification forecast models.
